USERS

Feature: Users Management
   Scenario: Updating user address as librarian should change current user address in DB
    Given the user logged in as "librarian"
    And the user navigates to "Users" page
    When the user clicks Edit User button
    And the user changes address information to "7925 Jones Branch Dr, #3300 Tysons, VA 22102, USA"
    And the user clicks save changes button
    Then "The user updated." message should appear
    And the users should see same address for related user in database
